# Front-end Developer Portfolio Example

Welcome to my portfolio websites repository, the repository contains all the essential files to get you started with the project as well as a step-by-step guide how to get the project setup in your local enviroment.

To get started with my project I've provided some simple steps

**Steps**
---------

**Download or Pull This Repo**
	Top of this page you can see where it says clone or download

**Install Prepros**
	Download the appropriate version for your OS https://prepros.io/downloads
	
**Install NodeJS and NPM**
    Download NodeJS and NPM https://nodejs.org/en/
    
**Load the project**    
  Download this IDE : https://code.visualstudio.com/ and the Live server from the VScode marketplace.
    
**Install Bootstrap**    
    Open up the **integrated terminal** via the **IDE options**, its located under **"view/terminal"** it will load up the project at the root. Next install bootstrap by using the command **"npm install"** in the terminal provided by the IDE. Wait the dependency shpould then install.

**Add Project to Prepros**
    Add repo to the prepros, a config file will then be generated
    
**Locate Styling In Prepros**
    You can find the main styling located at **"./assets/stylesheet/APP.scss"**. Click **"Process file"**, this will then precompile the file, it will also watch the file so any changes made it will rerun proving no errors are found.
    **NOTE:** Others files will compile, watch out.
    
**Editing the Styling**
    Find the appropriate section, for example if you are editing the menu styling it will be in the **"3-layouts/menu.scss"**. When you save any files it will compile them. Any errors it will alert you, you will need to fix them and resave until it compiles correctly.
    
**Note 1:** If you get stuck with editing direct message me and I will assist you.

**Note 2:** You can use CSS with SCSS. SCSS just makes SCSS easy to maintain.
